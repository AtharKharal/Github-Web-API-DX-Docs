# List IdP groups for a team (Legacy)

**Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`List IdP groups for a team`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/team_sync/#list-idp-groups-for-a-team) endpoint.

Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
